The eastbound pipeline would import natural gas condensate and the westbound pipeline would export crude oil to the new marine terminal in Kitimat where it will be transported to Asian markets by oil tankers. The project was proposed in mid-2000s and has been postponed several times. The project is being developed by Enbridge Inc. , a Canadian crude oil and liquids pipeline company. The pipeline and terminal, if completed, would provide 104\u00A0permanent jobs in Alberta and British Columbia and 3,000\u00A0temporary jobs during construction. First Nations groups, environmentalists and oil sands opponents, among others, denounce the project because of immense environmental, social and cultural risks posed by the pipeline. Proponents argue the pipeline will instead provide aboriginal groups with equity ownership, training, employment, Community Trust and stewardship programs. The Douglas Channel that leads into Kitimat and surrounding northwest coast waters pose safety and weather hazards for oil tankers. The pipeline has been heavily criticized by native groups, as the pipeline traverses much of their traditional lands and threatens habitat for wild salmon. Groups like the Yinka Dene Alliance have been organized to campaign against the project. In December 2010, over 61\u00A0First Nations bands in British Columbia, including many along the proposed pipeline route, signed the Save The Fraser Declaration in opposition to the project. The pipeline has also been criticized by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), citing Enbridge's spotty history with pipeline installation and numerous spills." , "lang" : "en" } ] ,
