DAVOS, Switzerland - Activists with a big fake polar bear have occupied a Shell service station in the Swiss resort of Davos to protest Royal Dutch Shell PLC's oil drilling in the Arctic.
About 25 activists from around Europe chained gas pumps together Friday at the station near where the World Economic Forum was being held and hung a banner on the roof reading "Arctic Oil - Too Risky."
Greenpeace helped stage the protest, raising concerns about dangers to the environment from Shell's drilling in Alaska and urging forum organizers to reconsider Shell's participation. A Shell drill barge ran aground on a remote Alaska island on New Year's Eve.
Shell officials, among the 2,500 corporate and political leaders in Davos this week, did not immediately respond to phone calls about the protest.
