The James Gang
Go ask Alice: Lewis Carroll’s heroine challenges plans for the Northern Gateway pipeline.
An illustrated article that takes a leaf from “Alice in Wonderland” has gained something of an online following, prompting thousands of people to urge the Canadian government to halt development of the Northern Gateway oil pipeline.
In this “visual essay,” posted by the Canadian activist Franke James at her Web site, Alice poses a series of questions about the pipeline’s environmental risks to the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, and his minister of natural resources, Joe Oliver, in brightly illustrated cartoon-like frames.
The piece has inspired over 6,700 viewers to sign and send an automated letter posted beneath the essay to the Canadian government, according to a counter on the Web site.
Plans call for the Northern Gateway oil pipeline to transport oil from Alberta’s oil sands to the coast of British Columbia.
 Ms. James argues that the Canadian government is pushing rapid development of the pipeline despite its potential to pollute the Great Bear rain forest and the coast of British Columbia. “I think that the average Canadian thinks that the tar sands are a big revenue generator for the economy” she said. She argues in her cartoon essay that the environmental risks outweigh the economic benefits.
Ms. James used to advance her environmental arguments in text-heavy articles but came to feel that no one was paying attention. “I realized that I had to start telling personal stories with words and pictures that would allow people to grasp the message quickly,” she said.
The Alice character springs from the notion that environmental decision-making in Canada has nonsensical parallels to Wonderland. “I’ve found Alice to be a great way to show this sense of wonder and justice,” she said.
